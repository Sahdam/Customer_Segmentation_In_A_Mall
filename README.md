# Customer Segmentation Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using data-driven techniques to identify distinct groups of customers based on their behavioral and demographic attributes. Customer segmentation is a critical step in business analytics, enabling organizations to:

- Understand customer heterogeneity
- Design targeted marketing strategies
- Improve customer retention
- Optimize product offerings

The analysis is implemented entirely in a **Jupyter Notebook**, making use of Python’s data science ecosystem for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.
